## Algorithm Introduction

Infrared Small Target Detection Algorithm Using an Augmented Intensity and Density-Based Clustering 
[Paper](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16023247/Infrared.Small.Target.Detection.Algorithm.Using.an.Augmented.Intensity.and.Density-Based.Clustering.pdf)

I has proposed a novel algorithm with clustering to achieve accurate single-frame infrared small target detection and develop an open-sourced infrared small target dataset (namely, SNU) in this paper. Experiments on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of my method. The contribution of this paper are as follows:

1. By analyzing factors that degrade target state estimation in IMM algorithms with a constant transition probability matrix, we have designed two correction functions for dynamically adjusting the Markov transition probability matrix. These are the polarization correction function and the activity correction function.

2. Our proposed method offers a fusion process that avoids the “rich get richer, and the poor get poorer” dilemma of two correction functions with opposite properties. Moreover, this new approach can be applied to both linear and nonlinear models and calculate transition probability adaptively and automatically. 

3. We have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm through simulations and ﬂight experiments by comparing it with existing IMM studies.
